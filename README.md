# dock-it-in-azure
Sample project to prove out running a Docker project in Azure

# Docker
The core of this project is actually creating a container and running it in Docker. So to get started, we need to have Docker installed.
So follow the directions found at https://docs.docker.com/windows/ (or change whatever is appropriate for your OS).
